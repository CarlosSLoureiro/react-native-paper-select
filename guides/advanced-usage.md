# Advanced Usage

You can customize, `PaperSelect` as per your requirement. Some of the customization options are:

* `textInputMode` - you have two material options to choose from `flat` and `outlined` . See [`screenshot`](../#examples).
* `modalDoneButtonText` - you can change the modal's button text in your language.

For more options, see [`Customizations`](customizations.md)

Check out the [`Example`](../example.md#code) code for advance usage.
